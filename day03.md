$ git commit -m "ORLY?"

# Once I'm ready to publish... then what?

$ git push origin master

# I want to make a publicly visible gh-pages "folder" (a.k.a. branch)
# AND I haven't already created it yet

$ git branch
$ git checkout -b gh-pages
$ git push origin gh-pages
# ALWAYS MAKE YOUR EDITS IN "master"
$ git checkout master

- and like all those other videos (do 1 or 2 a night, it's amaze :doge:)

## Notes:

- we talked about common HTML tags vs display type,
- shorthand properties,
- ems,
- and we threw in an entire discussion on positioning and layout approaches from http://learnlayout.com/

## Pics of Whiteboards

## Homework

Remember!

- wireframe it, think about structure and how today's lecture can help you do 70-80% of the work.
- keep it simple, worry about structure and layout first, THEN worry about small details

Make sure to:

1. Create a Github repo
2. Clone that repo
3. Code the site
4. Even if it isn't perfect, send me your Github repo link and the `gh-pages` link
