# Schedule

- Class is from `September 22` to `December 19, 2014`.
- Lecture is from `9.30 AM to 12:30 or 1 PM Monday-Thursday`, with breaks during that time. Depending on the topic, we may end earlier or later. :-)
- Lab time is from `1 PM to 5 PM Monday-Thursday` and `9 AM to 5 PM` on Friday!

# Office hours and one-on-one instruction

A teacher or TA will be available Monday-Friday from 9 AM to 5 PM at minimum. During lab time, you can schedule one-on-one time with either of us. After hours, we may be available in the classroom or in HipChat, which we use for group communication.

# Holidays

We will take three days off for Thanksgiving, November 26-28th.

# Materials

All students must bring their own MacBook laptop. I recommend the 13" MacBook Air. I have had one for three years, I use it almost too often, and it has never failed on me. :-)

Your MacBook must be running OS X Mavericks. Mavericks is a free upgrade from the App Store.

There is no commercial software required for the class. For the class, we will install a number of tools (a special install script will be provided for this):

- Create an SSH key
	- run `ssh-keygen` in your terminal
- Hipchat (http://hipchat.com)
- Signup for Github if you haven't, and cover this tutorial (https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

# After class ends..

> ... you will be looking for those next steps. Check out the following ideas:

- Sign up for weekly newletters to get the latest and greatest content:
	- HackerNewsList,
	- JavaScriptWeekly,
	- WebDesignWeekly,
	- [WDRL](http://tinyletter.com/wdrl),
	- [Sidebar.io](http://sidebar.io/),
	- CSS Weekly,
	- CSS Tricks,
	- HTML5 Weekly,
	- Daily JS,
	- Smashing Magazine,
	- A List Apart
- Start using a web-based RSS reader, like http://feedly.com.
- Check out this article on how someone got 32 offers from startups in a few days. NOTE: You should probably be willing to travel. http://thenextweb.com/entrepreneur/2014/11/06/use-angellist-win-30-consulting-offers-30-days/.
- You may want to try your hand at freelancing or doing some side-projects. Check out the [job resources list](./examples/extras/job-resources.md) for that. You can also check out https://github.com/ericdodds/the-little-freelancer to learn more about the process of freelancing.
- You may want to try some public speaking and presentations, as well. This is a really powerful skill that is a career force-multiplier, and in conjunction with being a good writer, will really boost your chances of landing a job.
	- Talk to Matt or JB about speaking at Houston.js: http://houstonjs.com
	- Talk to Matt or JB about speaking or volunteering at Space City JS: http://spacecityjs.com
	- Find other conferences out there! If you are chosen to speak, typically your flight and hotel is paid for by the conference: http://lanyrd.com/calls/. It's a great way to travel on someone else's dime, too. :-)
- Participate in Hackathons, such as Matt's http://hacktoberfe.st :-)
- Read source code of popular projects (i.e. jQuery, Backbone) and Codepens. Learn the architecture and problem-solving. Learn **why** someone did something.

# Prework

Here is some prework to prepare for The Iron Yard's Front End Course!

Prework is material to help you get on the same page as others. Do the best you can, and let Matt know how it's going! :-)

What is prework?

- a series of base information designed to bring you up to speed as much as possible before the class. We have some online coursework, tools, and advanced materials for those of you who want to go further.
- starting learning before the class is like training for a marathon. You don't show up the day of the race and start, you need to train beforehand. In our classes, your brain is the muscle that needs to train. This prework is training for your brain.
- Prework only covers the basics of a language; What we teach goes much deeper than tutorials can cover.

If you haven't already, start these courses and go as far as you can:

- For HTML/CSS, start the Codecademy HTML and CSS course (according to them, 7 hours): http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web, and https://dash.generalassemb.ly/
- For JS, start the Codecademy JavaScript course: http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript
- For Git, start https://www.codeschool.com/courses/git-real

Spending ~ 1-2 hours each day on the courses will round out any foundational knowledge necessary to start Matt's class.

If you are ready for more advanced stuff, whet your whistle with this bonus material:

- watch these podcasts (there are new releases approx. every week): http://www.atozcss.com/
- start the Codecademy jQuery course: http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/jquery
- Rocked the other stuff and still hungry for more? Have a read through of Douglas Crockford’s “JavaScript: The Good Parts”: http://it-ebooks.info/book/274/

# Policies

Sounds boring, but these are important:

- Absences and timeliness - You can miss up to 4 lectures; after that, your enrollment in career support is forfeit. I don't recommend missing any, as we will be moving very fast! This is to help with expectations: I show up, you show up, we all show up --- and kick ass! :-) Also, please show up on time. We count 2 lates as an absence. All I ask for is general respect of the crew and class so that we can learn without constant hiccups and interruptions!

- Late or incomplete homework - Your homework is due by 9 AM on the assigned day. After that, it is late. If you miss homework assignments, come talk to me, because I know problems and emergencies can happen. However, you will be required to make up for late/incomplete assignments, so don't fall behind! I would rather see a solid attempt on time than a complete assignment late. Solid attempts are not considered late!

- Honor - You are expected to do your own work. If you don't, why are you here? You should use all resources available to you, including open-source code, but copy and pasting open-source code is prohibited: you should use it only for inspiration or as a library in a bigger project. Copying homework is taken very seriously and can result in forfeiting career support.

- Conduct - I run a class based on human decency and respect - I want everyone to be welcome. Generally spoken, if something can be taken the wrong way, be careful how you say it! Got an issue with someone? **If you ever have any issues, just reach out to me or any of The Iron Yard employees. I promise we will represent everyone fairly and equally, and we generally care for the well-being of our students.**
