# Schedule

- Class is from September 22 to December 19, 2014.
- Lecture is from 9.30 AM to 12:30 or 1 PM Monday-Thursday, with breaks during that time. Depending on the topic, we may end earlier or later. :-)
- Lab time is from 1 PM to 5 PM Monday-Thursday and 9 AM - 5 PM on Friday!

# Office hours and one-on-one instruction

A teacher or TA will be available Monday-Friday from 9 AM to 5 PM at minimum. During lab time, you can schedule one-on-one time with either of us. After hours, we may be available in the classroom or in HipChat, which we use for group communication.

# Holidays

We will take three days off for Thanksgiving, November 26-28th.

# Materials

All students must bring their own MacBook laptop. I recommend the 13" MacBook Air. I have had one for three years, I use it almost too often, and it has never failed on me. :-)

Your MacBook must be running OS X Mavericks. Mavericks is a free upgrade from the App Store.

There is no commercial software required for the class. For the class, we will install:

- Google Chrome (https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/)
- Sublime Text 3 (http://www.sublimetext.com/3)
- Spectacle (http://spectacleapp.com/)
- Node.js (http://nodejs.org/)
- Git (and Github for Mac)
	- download and install Github for Mac (https://mac.github.com/)
	- then follow these instructions to install Git CLI (Command Line Interface) Tools (https://github.com/blog/1510-installing-git-from-github-for-mac)
- Create an SSH key
	- run `ssh-keygen` in your terminal

# Policies

Sounds boring, but these are important:

- Absences and timeliness - You can miss up to 4 lectures; after that, your enrollment in career support is forfeit. I don't recommend missing any, as we will be moving very fast! This is to help with expectations: I show up, you show up, we all show up --- and kick ass! :-) Also, please show up on time. We count 2 lates as an absence. All I ask for is general respect of the crew and class so that we can learn without constant hiccups and interruptions!

- Late or incomplete homework - Your homework is due by 9 AM on the assigned day. After that, it is late. If you miss homework assignments, come talk to me, because I know problems and emergencies can happen. However, you will be required to make up for late/incomplete assignments, so don't fall behind! I would rather see a solid attempt on time than a complete assignment late. Solid attempts are not considered late!

- Honor - You are expected to do your own work. If you don't, why are you here? You should use all resources available to you, including open-source code, but copy and pasting open-source code is prohibited: you should use it only for inspiration or as a library in a bigger project. Copying homework is taken very seriously and can result in forfeiting career support.

- Conduct - I run a class based on human decency and respect - I want everyone to be welcome. Generally spoken, if something can be taken the wrong way, be careful how you say it! Got an issue with someone? **If you ever have any issues, just reach out to me or any of The Iron Yard employees. I promise we will represent everyone fairly and equally, and we generally care for the well-being of our students.**
