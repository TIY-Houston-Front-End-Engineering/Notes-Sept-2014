# Schedule

- Class is from `September 22` to `December 19, 2014`.
- Lecture is from `9.30 AM to 12:30 or 1 PM Monday-Thursday`, with breaks during that time. Depending on the topic, we may end earlier or later. :-)
- Lab time is from `1 PM to 5 PM Monday-Thursday` and `9 AM to 5 PM` on Friday!

# Office hours and one-on-one instruction

A teacher or TA will be available Monday-Friday from 9 AM to 5 PM at minimum. During lab time, you can schedule one-on-one time with either of us. After hours, we may be available in the classroom or in HipChat, which we use for group communication.

# Holidays

We will take three days off for Thanksgiving, November 26-28th.

# Materials

All students must bring their own MacBook laptop. I recommend the 13" MacBook Air. I have had one for three years, I use it almost too often, and it has never failed on me. :-)

Your MacBook must be running OS X Mavericks. Mavericks is a free upgrade from the App Store.

There is no commercial software required for the class. For the class, we will install a number of tools (a special install script will be provided for this):

- Create an SSH key
	- run `ssh-keygen` in your terminal
- Hipchat (http://hipchat.com)
- Signup for Github if you haven't, and cover this tutorial (https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

# After class ends..

> ... you will be looking for those next steps. Check out the following ideas:

- Sign up for weekly newletters to get the latest and greatest content:
	- HackerNewsList,
	- JavaScriptWeekly,
	- WebDesignWeekly,
	- [WDRL](http://tinyletter.com/wdrl),
	- [Sidebar.io](http://sidebar.io/),
	- CSS Weekly,
	- CSS Tricks,
	- HTML5 Weekly,
	- Daily JS,
	- Smashing Magazine,
	- A List Apart
- Start using a web-based RSS reader, like http://feedly.com.
- Check out this article on how someone got 32 offers from startups in a few days. NOTE: You should probably be willing to travel. http://thenextweb.com/entrepreneur/2014/11/06/use-angellist-win-30-consulting-offers-30-days/.
- You may want to try your hand at freelancing or doing some side-projects. Check out the [job resources list](./examples/extras/job-resources.md) for that. You can also check out https://github.com/ericdodds/the-little-freelancer to learn more about the process of freelancing.
- You may want to try some public speaking and presentations, as well. This is a really powerful skill that is a career force-multiplier, and in conjunction with being a good writer, will really boost your chances of landing a job.
	- Talk to Matt or JB about speaking at Houston.js: http://houstonjs.com
	- Talk to Matt or JB about speaking or volunteering at Space City JS: http://spacecityjs.com
	- Find other conferences out there! If you are chosen to speak, typically your flight and hotel is paid for by the conference: http://lanyrd.com/calls/. It's a great way to travel on someone else's dime, too. :-)
- Participate in Hackathons, such as Matt's http://hacktoberfe.st :-)
- Read source code of popular projects (i.e. jQuery, Backbone) and Codepens. Learn the architecture and problem-solving. Learn **why** someone did something.

# Prework

Here is some prework to prepare for The Iron Yard's Front End Course!

Prework is material to help you get on the same page as others. Do the best you can, and let Matt know how it's going! :-)

What is prework?

- a series of base information designed to bring you up to speed as much as possible before the class. We have some online coursework, tools, and advanced materials for those of you who want to go further.
- starting learning before the class is like training for a marathon. You don't show up the day of the race and start, you need to train beforehand. In our classes, your brain is the muscle that needs to train. This prework is training for your brain.
- Prework only covers the basics of a language; What we teach goes much deeper than tutorials can cover.

If you haven't already, start these courses and go as far as you can:

- For HTML/CSS, start the Codecademy HTML and CSS course (according to them, 7 hours): http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web, and https://dash.generalassemb.ly/
- For JS, start the Codecademy JavaScript course: http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript
- For Git, start https://www.codeschool.com/courses/git-real

Spending ~ 1-2 hours each day on the courses will round out any foundational knowledge necessary to start Matt's class.

If you are ready for more advanced stuff, whet your whistle with this bonus material:

- watch these podcasts (there are new releases approx. every week): http://www.atozcss.com/
- start the Codecademy jQuery course: http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/jquery
- Rocked the other stuff and still hungry for more? Have a read through of Douglas Crockford’s “JavaScript: The Good Parts”: http://it-ebooks.info/book/274/

# Policies

Sounds boring, but these are important:

- Absences and timeliness - You can miss up to 4 lectures; after that, your enrollment in career support is forfeit. I don't recommend missing any, as we will be moving very fast! This is to help with expectations: I show up, you show up, we all show up --- and kick ass! :-) Also, please show up on time. We count 2 lates as an absence. All I ask for is general respect of the crew and class so that we can learn without constant hiccups and interruptions!

- Late or incomplete homework - Your homework is due by 9 AM on the assigned day. After that, it is late. If you miss homework assignments, come talk to me, because I know problems and emergencies can happen. However, you will be required to make up for late/incomplete assignments, so don't fall behind! I would rather see a solid attempt on time than a complete assignment late. Solid attempts are not considered late!

- Honor - You are expected to do your own work. If you don't, why are you here? You should use all resources available to you, including open-source code, but copy and pasting open-source code is prohibited: you should use it only for inspiration or as a library in a bigger project. Copying homework is taken very seriously and can result in forfeiting career support.

- Conduct - I run a class based on human decency and respect - I want everyone to be welcome. Generally spoken, if something can be taken the wrong way, be careful how you say it! Got an issue with someone? **If you ever have any issues, just reach out to me or any of The Iron Yard employees. I promise we will represent everyone fairly and equally, and we generally care for the well-being of our students.**

# Final Projects

> Also called the *Capstone Projects*

This is going to be a large project that you will carry out **BY YOURSELF OR WITH A RAILS STUDENT** to show off on Demo Day (Friday, December 12th).

## Here are some technical requirements for your Final Projects:

- You must either do the project**BY YOURSELF OR WITH A RAILS STUDENT**. If you partner with a Rails student, the Rails student will create an API, and you will connect to it via vanilla jQuery or Backbone.js.
- You must make atleast 25 commits throughout the 3 week period.
- You must have tests written for your project. No matter how simple they are, **You must write test**.
- You must use a script loader. (loader.js)
- You must have `"use strict";` in your code.
- You must implement proper error handling if arguments don't meet expectations (`throw new Error("some error message")`).
- You must use lodash templates.
- You must use use atleast 2 different service APIs.
- You must use atleast 2 different Browser APIs.
- You must either include polyfills for older browsers, or gracefully show error messages for browsers that don't support a Browser API.
- You must structure your code with Single Responsibility Principle in mind.
- Your UI must be **responsive** and work on both desktop and mobile
- Your app must **SAVE DATA** be it through an authenticated API from `hello.js`, a Rails API, or Firebase.

## Further Requirements BEFORE YOU CODE ANYTHING

- If you have 2 REST APIs, you will probably have two sets of (Collections / Models) for each. List what they would be.
- You will always focus on an MVP (Minimum Viable Product); which means you will have to *ruthlessly* prioritize features of your app
- Your Project proposal to me (Matt) must start with an elevator pitch:
    - 15 to 25 words of what your app does
- You will outline the MVP features in a clearly documented bulletpoint list.
- You will need to research your APIs (especially when doing a solo project) to ensure you can talk to that API without a server-side proxy. If a server-side proxy is needed, **you need to verify this immediately and let Matt know**.
- You will document **all** the technologies and libraries to be used in the project.
- You will document atleast 5 User Stories about your app.
    - e.g. _"As an admin user, I want the ability to create courses so that learners can see what courses are available."_

    User stores follow this structure: "As a ________ I want _______ so that ________"


## Chronological outline and things to consider

- **EVERY DAY** - you will checkin with me, tell me what you did yesterday, what you plan to do today, and what "blockers" you are running into.

#### Week 1

- wireframe the UI, draw it out, and plan it step by step
- plan your API code, coordinate with your Ruby teammate (if any), and figure out how to save information to Ruby from Backbone.
- use Agile practices to breakdown your **software features** into **user stories**.
    - prioritize the most important features
    - then prioritize the most important user stories

#### Week 2

- develop
- write tests
- review with Matt atleast twice during the week

#### Week 3

- develop
- write tests
- review with Matt atleast twice during the week
