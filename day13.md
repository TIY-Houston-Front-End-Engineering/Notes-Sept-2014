```js
    function Character(name){
        this.name = name;
    }

    Character.prototype.fight = function(){
        console.log(this.name, this.power);
    }

    function Wizard(name){
        Character.apply(this, arguments);

# Books!

- http://eloquentjavascript.net/
- I brought books into class. There are 8 books in total. If you don't take them home, put them in the closet.

# Resources

- Don't forget about http://bonsaiden.github.io/JavaScript-Garden which still has a TON to keep reading over.

# Homework

## Part 1

Complete your [day 12 homework](./day12.md)

## Part 2

> This is to be done as a group assignment. We may have one group of 3 students.
> 1. Send me a hipchat or email about who is on who's team
> 2. Have one person Create a Github Repo for the project, then each other person will need to be added as collaborators (see https://help.github.com/articles/adding-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository/).
> 3. Remember back to our discussion on Git and merge conflicts. Those problems can and probably will arise. :-)

1. Write your own forEach function (like we did in class). It takes the array and the function (referred to as a callback) as arguments:
    ```js
    function forEach(list, callback) { /* Do stuff */ }
    ```

2. Write your own map, reduce, and filter functions that use your custom forEach to do their work.

3. Write a function called pluck that extracts a list of property names:
    ```js
    function pluck(list, propertyName) { /* Do stuff*/ }

    var stooges = [{name: 'moe', age: 40}, {name: 'larry', age: 50}, {name: 'curly', age: 60}];
    pluck(stooges, 'name');
    // => ["moe", "larry", "curly"]
    ```

4. Write a function called reject that returns the values in list without the elements that the truth test (predicate) passes. The opposite of filter.
    ```js
    function reject(list, predicate) { /* Do stuff */ }

    var odds = reject([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], function(num){ return num % 2 == 0; });
    //=> [1, 3, 5]
    ```

5. Write a function called find that looks through each value in the list, returning the first one that passes a truth test (predicate), or undefined if no value passes the test. The function returns as soon as it finds an acceptable element, and doesn't traverse the entire list.
    ```js
    function find(list, predicate) { /* Do stuff */ }

    var even = find([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], function(num){ return num % 2 == 0; });
    //=> 2
    ```

6. Write a function called where that looks through each value in the list, returning an array of all the values that contain all of the key-value pairs listed in properties.
    ```js
    function where(list, properties) { /* Do stuff */ }

    where(listOfPlays, {author: "Shakespeare", year: 1611});
    // => [{title: "Cymbeline", author: "Shakespeare", year: 1611},
    //     {title: "The Tempest", author: "Shakespeare", year: 1611}]
    ```
