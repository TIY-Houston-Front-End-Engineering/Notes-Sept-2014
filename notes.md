questions for Pete:

- quarterly profit sharing...
- new instructors... JB -> FE, Matt -> Mobile?
- In Houston it looks likely that we'll go with 3115 Allen Parkway. We're waiting on buildout numbers from the contractor so that we can get the final pricing and lease.
	- How can we help / move this along for Jan?
- John is going to lead a project this fall to get Pathwright implemented for prework, job placement training & resources, during class resources, and recommended supplemental courses post class. We're going to start with job placement training, John's personal branding talk, and a number of other non core classes

# 3 big things are in the works but we don't have all of the details worked out yet:

- We're putting together an options/equity pool. I'm not sure yet if this is going to be options, stock, or phantom stock but we're most likely switching from a LLC to a C corp this fall and with that we'll create this pool and plan to give each of you stock in the company. I don't have many more details yet, still working through legal. As we roll this out this will most likely replace the current profit sharing model
- We're taking a serious look at acquiring a west coast code school.
- We're actively discussing taking another round of capital. This will allow us to continue our growth but allow us to grow the team to support that growth first.
