/ Today we covered review of yesterday,   \
| which includes $.when, $.get, Promises  |
| (.then), _.template, and the setup      |
| shell script I provided. Additionally,  |
| we covered Prototypes and Constructors  |
| today, as well as the keyword. Finally, |
| I live-coded an ugly version of the     |
\ Github repo page.                       /
