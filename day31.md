# Backbone an MVC (Model-View-Controller) JavaScript Framework

We've just finished our stint in API's. We've learned that API's have a lot to offer, and that they make a service or ecosystem of apps more scalable and open, where we can integrate almost any services we choose into a nice "mashup".

We've already hit the nail on the head when it comes to MVC structure. The rest of the class is all about MVC frameworks, patterns, and problem-solving with code.

So let's have a gander again at MVC one last time. An MVC application is broken into three parts:

- `M` - Model: the data/JSON stored from an API, and the methods that pull the data from an API
- `V` - View: the templates created, and maybe the methods that draw them to the screen
- `C` - Controller: the mechanisms used to control application flow and state, such as with Path.js to handle hash-routes

Most of the time, the Model is the part of our code that pulls and pushes information back-and-forth to an API.
