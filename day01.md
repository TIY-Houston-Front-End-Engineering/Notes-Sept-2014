Happy first day! Today we:

- covered some basic stuff on keyboard shortcuts,
- installed some programs,
- covered creating the HTML boilerplate code in Sublime Text,
- covered the ipsums (http://meettheipsums.com/),
- talked about `display:block` and `display:inline-block`,
- built a very simple blog layout,
- talked a bit about the Box Model,
- and mentioned some various resources (which will be listed below)

- Read about layout with CSS (mainly about `display` and `position`): http://learnlayout.com/
- Watch "The Long Game pt 1 and 2": http://delve.tv/essays/
- Copy the code from today, and experiment with as many HTML tags as possible
	- tags: http://www.w3schools.com/tags/
	- code from today: [link to code](./examples/day01)
	- When you finish, just zip your files and email them to me. We will be putting them on the "internets" tomorrow with Git!
