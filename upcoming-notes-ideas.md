## Week 9 

- Start brainstorming final projects

    > I'm sure there are more concepts than this, but for example, if the app covered a list like this would it be sufficient for us to judge their skill set and knowledge?
    >
    >
        - Creation of the framework, with a DB initialized
        - App is checked into GitHub with a valid README
        - App is deployed onto Heroku showing understanding of deployment with at least one provider
        - App utilizes at least one gem, beyond user auth.
        - App has user authentication
        - Test cases exist testing major parts of the application
        - Models use has_many, has_one, belongs_to and has_many through
        - There is some basic caching used
        - The asset pipeline is correctly used
        - There is one example of CRUD
        - The User model has at least two roles
