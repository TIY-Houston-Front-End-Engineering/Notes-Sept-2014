# Homework

This is going to be a large, group homework assignment due Thursday, Oct 30th.

Here are some requirements:

1. You must have a group of atleast 2 people, and each person must either fork the repo or be a contributor on that repo. **Each person must make atleast 15 commits throughout the week. I will verify and check.**
2. You must have tests written for your project.
3. You must use a script loader.
4. You must have `"use strict";` in your code.
5. You must implement proper error handling if arguments don't meet expectations (`throw new Error("some error message")`).
6. You must use lodash templates.
7. You must use use atleast 2 different service APIs (one of those APIs cannot be Etsy).
8. You must use atleast 2 different Browser APIs, and you must either include polyfills for older browsers, or gracefully show error messages for browsers that don't support a Browser API.
9. You must structure your code with Single Responsibility Principle in mind.
10. You must use jQuery Promises. :-)

# Model-View-Controller

We've just finished our stint in the Etsy API. We've learned that API's have a lot to offer, and that they make a service or ecosystem of apps more scalable and open, where we can integrate almost any services we choose into a nice "mashup".

We've already hit the nail on the head when it comes to MVC structure. The rest of the class is all about MVC frameworks, patterns, and problem-solving with code.

So let's have a gander again at MVC on last time. An MVC application is broken into three parts:

- `M` - Model: the data/JSON stored from Etsy, and maybe the methods that pull the data from the Etsy API
- `V` - View: the templates created, and maybe the methods that draw them to the screen
- `C` - Controller: the mechanisms used to control application flow and state, such as with Path.js to handle hash-routes

Most of the time, the Model is the part of our code that pulls and pushes information back-and-forth to an API.

So with that...

# Happy API days!

We are going to do a project on working with 2 or more real APIs. If you recall, APIs provide 3 primary methods for us front-end devs to access them:

1. CORS - JSON (not all are CORS)
2. non-CORS - JSONP (not all are JSONP)
3. server-side proxy (our local server makes the JSON request for us, and returns it to the browser)

Method 3 is a little harder for us to implement, but we'll get there soon. :-)

Now, we've been doing `$.get()` enough to get information from Etsy, for example, but we haven't used `$.post()` to push any information up to a live service.

By **authenticating** with a service, we can actually push information up to services. One particular library that can help us do that is `hello.js` (http://adodson.com/hello.js/#install).

Aside from what `hello.js` provides access to, the following list is a large list of APIs that provide a mix of CORS/JSONP/proxy-able services:
